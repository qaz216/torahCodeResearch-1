Ripps paper here:

Ripps Paper and Source Data are the result of 11 years of research by the papers authors.  It is my understanding that the authors went into this paper as athiest and have emerged as religious Jews.  This is the 'Only' peer-reviewed paper on the Torah Codes ever published up until this point in time (10/27/2024).  

The Ripps paper is seminal and that is what makes this data set so valuable.

I have obtained the character-by-character data set used in this experiment.  It is a long story, but I was able to get this data set personally from someone involoved in the research.

Raw Data Here:

Genesis:
https://github.com/aryehgolob/torahCodeResearch/blob/master/data/bible/Genesis.txt

Exodus:
https://github.com/aryehgolob/torahCodeResearch/blob/master/data/bible/Exodus.txt

Leviticus:
https://github.com/aryehgolob/torahCodeResearch/blob/master/data/bible/Leviticus.txt

Deuteronomy:
https://github.com/aryehgolob/torahCodeResearch/blob/master/data/bible/Deuteronomy.txt

Numbers:
https://github.com/aryehgolob/torahCodeResearch/blob/master/data/bible/Numbers.txt

I have validated this data against the widely referenced 'Michael Dov Weissmandl' (Weissmandl Sequence) by myself.

I have personally validated that this data represents the exact character for character sequence of the 5 books of the Bible to the best of my knowledge and my understanding of biblical hebrew.  The oldest known version of this document can be dated back to the "Dead Sea Scrolls" of 2000+ years ago.  Jewish scollorship dates this document at apx: 3,300 years ago at which time this document was transfered by G-d to the Jewish Nation at Mount Sinai.

I was put in touch with someone involved in this research and have obtained the above 5 data sets (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Deuteronomy, Numbers).
